# CLN Demo

Navigate to the `cln-demo` folder.

Build and start your service stack:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> in the same window to gracefully bring down your service stack.


Use `compose down` to bring down your service stack in detached mode (or in another terminal).

```bash
# Run in the same location as your compose.yml:
docker compose down
```
