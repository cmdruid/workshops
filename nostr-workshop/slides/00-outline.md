# Workshop Part 1

## What is Nostr?

- Nostr stands for (N)otes and (O)ther (S)tuff (T)ransmitted by (R)elay
- It is a decentralized messaging protocol.
- It uses modern cryptography, but in a simple way.

## Key Features

- Websockets
- Identity Ownership
- Simulcasting
- Dumb relays, smart clients

## Other Models

- Centralized (Twitter, Facebook, Signal)
- Federated (Mastadon, Matrix, IRC, Email)
- Decentralized (Jabber, Scuttlebutt, Bitmessage, DIDs)

## Downsides

- Lack of monetary incentive to host relays.
- Development of standards can be messy.
- User experience can be rough.

## Why Nostr?

- Other protocols suck (no adoption, difficult to use, bogged down by standards).
- Built by builders, for builders.
- Protocol is very simple, opinionated, and easy to use.
- Protocol sticks to doing one simple thing and doing it well.

# Workshop Part 2

## What is a Nostr Note

Example of a nostr note.

## What is a subscription

Example of a filter and subscription.

## What are websockets?

Websockets are long-lived HTTP connections.
HTTP traditionally uses a request-response model, which requires negotiating a new connection each time.



## What is a relay?

- A relay is a webserver that stores notes and delivers subscriptions.
